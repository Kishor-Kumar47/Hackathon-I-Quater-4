The following points require clarification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project:

1. Book Structure:
   - Should the book follow a strict week-by-week layout as in the course outline,
     or should it be organized by modules (ROS 2, Isaac, Gazebo, VLA, etc.)?

2. Code Examples:
   - Should code samples be provided in both Python and C++ for ROS 2,
     or only Python (rclpy) as the minimum viable requirement?

3. Hardware Section:
   - Should hardware recommendations be explained in detail inside the book,
     or added as an appendix?

4. RAG Chatbot:
   - Should the chatbot appear on all pages as a floating widget,
     or only on specific chapters?
   - Should it support voice input or only text?

5. Personalization Feature:
   - When a user presses “Personalize Chapter,” what type of personalization is expected?
     - Beginner-friendly explanation?
     - Add/remove advanced content?
     - Adjust reading level based on user background?

6. Urdu Translation:
   - Should translation be paragraph-by-paragraph,
     whole-chapter,
     or dynamic inline toggling?

7. Subagents & Skills:
   - Should each chapter use separate AI subagents (e.g., ROS Agent, Isaac Agent),
     or one shared agent with multiple skills?

8. Deployment:
   - Should the Docusaurus book be deployed on GitHub Pages only,
     or is deployment on Vercel acceptable as final?

9. Demo Video:
   - Should the 90-second demo focus mainly on:
        a. Book UI + RAG Chatbot,
        b. GitHub repo + code,
        c. Personalization + Urdu features,
        d. Or all combined?

10. Capstone Section:
    - Should the book include a full implementation guide:
        “Voice → LLM → ROS → Navigation → Object Manipulation”
      or only conceptual explanation?
