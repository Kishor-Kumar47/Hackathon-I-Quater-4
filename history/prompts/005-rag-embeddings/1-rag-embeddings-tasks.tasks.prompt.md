# Response Text

Created comprehensive tasks.md file for RAG Embeddings System with 81 tasks organized across 8 phases. Tasks are organized by user stories (US1, US2, US3) with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. All tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, task IDs, story labels where appropriate, and file paths. The implementation strategy focuses on MVP-first approach with incremental delivery.

# Outcome

Complete task breakdown ready for implementation phase.
